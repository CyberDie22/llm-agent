**Morrie Final: Life 101**

***For your final project of this novel,  you will be creating a “visual essay” (film documentary style).  Similar to Morrie, you will be sharing life lessons for yourself and the next generation.  Focus on what impact you want to have on the world just as Morrie did.  Please follow the steps below.***

1. You will pick a person to interview that is at least 50 years old. **This interview needs to be filmed.**


2. You will write a list of at least ten interview questions.  These questions should be geared towards pulling important life lessons from your interviewee. They have a wealth of experience, and it is your job to get as much of that wealth as possible.  *Your questions can touch on mistakes to avoid, love life advice, money managing advice, college life advice, things they would do differently in retrospect, etc.* (Think of the topics Mitch and Morrie covered in their Tuesdays.)

3. You will take on the role of valedictorian and write a graduation speech for your class. The speech is about whatever you’d like to make it about.  If you had the opportunity to go up there and speak in front of your classmates and their families, what message would you want to get across?

4. You can use a program or app (Clip Champ, Clipcut, iMovie (mac), moviemaker (windows), LOOM, etc.) to create a short documentary that combines elements of your interview and your graduation speech.  

Your documentary will need to include the following: 

a. The most **significant** parts or lessons from your interview. 

b. Background music    
c. Transitions   
d. Additional visuals (film scenery scenes, campus scenes, pictures of you growing up, other images you deem relevant to  your visual essay) 

e. Record yourself giving your graduation speech (audio or video recording) and insert parts of  your speech into your documentary where you see fit.  

f. An imprint of the impact you would like to have on the world (this could be-but isn’t limited to a quote or picture at the end of your documentary). 

Your finished product should be approximately 3-5 minutes and will include all parts of the assignment to create a powerful piece that you can refer back to or pass on to someone.

***Grading:***

***20 points \- Completeness*** \- Final product includes all elements of the assignment (video interview, graduation speech, script, and documentary.

***20 points \- Thoughtfulness*** \- Your interview questions and graduation speech include appropriate and quality lessons.

***10 points \- Effort*** \- You took the time to create a documentary that is visually appealing (smooth transitions, background music, text, scenery shots, other creative ideas, etc.)   
Step by Step Guide  
**Step 1:** Write interview 10-15 questions (handout below).

**Step 2:** Record the entire interview from beginning to end.  

**Step 3:** Analyze the video and the responses. 

**Step 4:** Write a speech based on the questions and responses you asked your interviewee. Question their responses and relate their answers to you and your life and what lies ahead in your future. 

**Step 5:** Recite the speech in front of a camera, try to make as much eye contact with the camera as possible, talk to your viewers and be direct. Record. 

**Step 6:** Make a script for the video (literally write exactly how the video will proceed).  Imagine the video in your head: 

For Example: (scripting)

| • Video opens with me, saying “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" then it cuts to a shot of my interview.  • Speech plays till I say "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" then cuts to the answer from interviewee from the question I asked.  • Add cinematic shot of CVHS campus. • Cut back to interviewee answering the question about what they would do differently if they could go back. • Cut to picture of interviewee when they were younger. • Etc. |

**Step 7:** If you scripted out any extra shots you don't have, film them, get extras if needed, record random things you think would be fitting. Follow the script when filming. 

**Step 8:** Edit all of your footage in the order of your video script. That's it; you're all done\!

The direction and cinematography is also beautiful.

Write down a list of potential questions for your interview.  Think of questions that are going to garner meaningful answers\!  Think about questions regarding love, money, college, work, school, what’s most important, regrets, things you must do, etc.  Once you have settled on a person to interview, pick your top ten questions to ask, but don’t feel restricted by your questions. If something comes to mind during your interview, ask\! If your person is taking the conversation in a different direction, let them talk. You never know where it could go\!
